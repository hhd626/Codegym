/**
 * Your task is to design an Artifact class.
 * There are three types of artifacts kept at the museum.
 * We know nothing about the first type except the serial number assigned by the museum (for example: 212121).
 * For the second type, we know the serial number and the culture that created it (for example: 212121, "Aztecs").
 * For the third type, we know the serial number, the culture that created it, and the century it was created in (for example: 212121, "Aztecs", 12).
